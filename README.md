Welcome to a robust framework designed for enterprise-grade security on iOS. This repository hosts a modular, scalable, and hermetic security layer that you can drop into iOS apps to enforce strong encryption, manage certificates, and maintain strict compliance. The framework is designed for teams that need formal security controls without sacrificing performance or user experience.

Key goals
- Provide strong, industry-standard encryption for data at rest and in transit.
- Deliver a flexible certificate management suite that supports PKI workflows, cert rotation, revocation, and pinning.
- Offer a suite of compliance tools aligned to GDPR, HIPAA, and SOX requirements, with auditable trails and policy enforcement.
- Support threat detection, anomaly alerts, and risk scoring to help protect critical assets.
- Integrate smoothly with existing Swift codebases via Swift Package Manager (SPM) and clear integration guides.

Overview
This framework is built with a pragmatic approach. It targets real-world iOS apps that handle sensitive data, such as financial information, health data, personally identifiable information, and enterprise credentials. It provides a cohesive set of components that work well together but are also modular enough to be used piecemeal. The goal is to give developers a trusted foundation while keeping the developer experience pleasant and productive.

What this framework solves
- Data protection: If your app stores or processes sensitive data, you need robust encryption. This framework provides AES-256, XTS mode where appropriate, and secure key management patterns designed for iOS devices.
- Certificate lifecycle: Certificates form the trust backbone of many enterprise workflows. The framework includes a certificate authority interface, certificate pinning options, automatic renewal workflows, and revocation checks.
- Compliance tooling: Real-time policy enforcement, audit trails, and data handling controls help you meet GDPR, HIPAA, and SOX requirements. The toolkit generates evidence artifacts that can be used during audits.
- Threat detection: Lightweight anomaly detection and threat signals help you detect unusual or unauthorized activity, enabling rapid response.
- Biometric security: When appropriate, you can combine biometric authentication with cryptographic operations to improve security without sacrificing usability.
- Enterprise readiness: The library is designed to scale, with clear module boundaries, testability, and a focus on maintainability.

What’s inside
- Crypto Engine: A flexible core for encryption, decryption, and cryptographic operations that abstracts away platform differences and provides a consistent API.
- Key Management: Secure key storage, derivation, and lifecycle management aligned with Apple’s security model. Includes support for secure enclave usage.
- Certificate Management: A modular certificate workflow, including enrollment, trust store updates, pinning strategies, and automatic rotation.
- Compliance Toolkit: Policies, auditing, and data handling controls that help you demonstrate compliance in a repeatable way.
- Threat Detection: Normal behavior baselines, anomaly detection, and alert generation. Integrates with your logging and monitoring stack.
- Audit Trails: Immutable, searchable records of security-critical events with configurable retention.
- Biometric Authentication: Interaction points for Face ID or Touch ID that can protect sensitive cryptographic operations.
- HSM and PKI integration: Bridging securely with hardware-backed roots and external PKI systems when needed.
- Swift Package Manager support: Easy integration into modern Swift codebases with clean dependency management.
- Testing and sample apps: End-to-end examples, unit tests, and integration tests to validate correctness and security.

Architecture and design principles
- Modularity: Each core capability is isolated behind a clear API. This makes it easy to adopt only the parts you need.
- Security by default: Default configurations lean toward strong protections. You can authorize more permissive modes only when you fully understand the risk.
- Compatibility: Works with iOS devices, supports various iOS versions, and aligns with Apple’s security guidance.
- Observability: Built-in instrumentation hooks, traceable events, and structured logging to help you observe behavior and validate compliance.
- Performance first: Encryption and cryptographic operations run efficiently. The design minimizes CPU usage and memory pressure on mobile devices.
- Clarity and simplicity: APIs are straightforward. The goal is to reduce the cognitive load for engineers who implement security features.

Architecture diagram (high level)
- Client apps call into a modular stack:
  - Crypto Engine -> Key Store (with Secure Enclave fallback) -> Certificate Manager
  - Policy Engine -> Compliance Toolkit -> Audit Trails
  - Threat Detector -> Alerts -> Notification System
  - Biometric Gate -> Secure Operations
- External integrations:
  - PKI providers for enrollment and revocation
  - HSMs for hardware-backed keys (where applicable)
  - Identity providers and enterprise SSO ecosystems
- Data flows:
  - Secrets are protected at rest, keys rotate, and secrets are used in memory with zero-copy patterns where possible
  - Audit events are written to an append-only store and periodically synced to a central server or log sink

How to install and use
- Swift Package Manager (SPM)
  - Add the package to your project in Xcode.
  - Resolve dependencies and import the modules you need.
  - Start with the Crypto Engine and Key Management modules; then layer in Certificate Management and Compliance tools as your security posture grows.
- Manual integration
  - If you’re not using SPM, you can still reference the framework binaries directly in your project with careful attention to versioning and compatibility.
- Typical workflow
  - Initialize the security context
  - Generate or load a cryptographic key
  - Encrypt sensitive data before storage or transmission
  - Sign or verify data as needed
  - Validate certificate status and apply policy checks
  - Record the event in the audit trail
  - Trigger biometric gates for high-sensitivity operations

Getting started with Swift Package Manager
- Add the package to your Package.swift or Xcode project
- Example Package.swift
  // swift-tools-version:5.7
  import PackageDescription

  let package = Package(
    name: "YourAppSecurity",
    platforms: [.iOS(.v13)],
    products: [
      .library(name: "SecurityFramework", targets: ["SecurityFramework"])
    ],
    dependencies: [
      // Add dependencies here if needed
    ],
    targets: [
      .target(name: "SecurityFramework", path: "Sources"),
      .testTarget(name: "SecurityFrameworkTests", dependencies: ["SecurityFramework"])
    ]
  )
